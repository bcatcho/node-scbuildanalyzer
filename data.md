## Logs of an scv mining an empty patch by himself. 
- I picked a patch that was not too close, not too far
- this is measures a complete cycle from the drop off point at a command center

Stages:
 0. Approach Resource
 1. Wait at Resource
 2. Harvest
 3. Wait to Return
 4. Wait for Drop Off
 5. Approach Drop Off
 6. Drop Off

gametime  stage
   08.75  0 approach
   10.56  1 wait at resource
   10.56  2 harvest
   13.38  3 wait to return    **what is this?**
   13.88  5 approach drop off  **Should it be the same time as this?**
   15.50  6 drop off

#! may need to take more measurements and average the intervals between stages
