## The Goal
Comparing the effects of changes to a build order through the use of graphs and other imagry.
-   Graphs need context. What do the numbers mean? How can you best convey to a bronze-plat the meaning of a 2 minute delay in expansion?
-   Perhaps one way of showing what a number means is to show the relative value of it in terms of what it can buy
    -  Hover over 150 min, see it in terms of marines, or tanks, lings, etc somehwere on the page.

## What this means for design
-  We need the ability to generate multiple graphs and compare them, second for second.
-  Choosing when to build supply is difficult. 
   Early in the game you can cut it close, but later in the game you often must build it 10 supply ahead. 
   I will ignore this for now and always build supply 3 food in advance.

Notes
-  Mineral patches are the bottleneck
   The first two workers on a patch will collect 40 min/sec, the 3rd will collect 20.
   3 workers per patch is all a patch can sustain due to travel time.
